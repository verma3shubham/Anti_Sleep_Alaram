# Anti_Sleep_Alaram
HARDWARE PROJECT
Description:
Designed and implemented a comprehensive safety system for vehicles aimed at detecting driver drowsiness and enhancing vehicle security. The system utilized infrared technology interfaced with relay modules to trigger specific actions based on driver conditions.

Key Components and Functions:

Infrared Detection Module: Implemented to monitor driver eye activity; detects when the driver's eyes are closed.
Relay Module Integration: Connected to the infrared module to initiate actions upon detecting closed eyes, ensuring timely response.
Power Management: Powered the system using a single 9V battery, ensuring reliability and portability.
Additional Simple Relays: Integrated two additional relays:
One relay for controlling sound alerts (e.g., alarms) triggered upon drowsiness detection.
Another relay for vehicle control, potentially disabling ignition or activating an alarm system in response to detected drowsiness.
Capacitor Utilization: Employed capacitors to sustain operation of the sound and vehicle control relays for a defined duration after power interruption, maintaining critical functions.
